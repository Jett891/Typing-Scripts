## Features üåü

Typing-Scripts offers several powerful features:

- **Menu Activation**: Press `F8` to open a configuration menu. Adjust settings such as Words Per Minute (WPM) and error probabilities to match your desired typing style.

- **Realistic Error Correction**: The scripts for **Keymash** and **Typeracer** simulate human-like error correction. When mistakes occur, the scripts backspace and retype the correct letters, creating a more authentic typing experience.

- **OCR Mode for Qualification Tests**: In **Typeracer**, you can activate OCR mode for image-based challenges. Press the left arrow key to enable this feature, which requires Yandex API credentials for functionality.

- **Keyboard Input Blocking**: The scripts intercept physical keyboard inputs. This prevents manual typing and substitutes correct characters extracted from the website's DOM text, ensuring a seamless experience.

- **Monkeytype**: Located in `monkeytype/monkeytype.js`  
- **10FastFingers**: Located in `10fastfingers/10fastfingers.js`
